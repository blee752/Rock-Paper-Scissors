# Rock-Paper-Scissors
TOP js foundation 1st project

goal is to create a rock paper scissors (RPS) game using JS. 

Initially done through console to gain understanding of JS functions. Once it functions through the console, Refactor the code to function through user inputs / event listeners.

Learning outcomes: solidfy the skills learned from the html and css sections and improve on JS fundamentals.

Takeaways:
1. RPS in the browser console
    * Improved understanding of Javascript functions
    * Getting inputs with prompt

2. RPS with added UI
    * Gained practice with basic element manipulations with javascript (changing text content, changing visibility of a modal window, Resetting functions and html elements)
    * Working with event listeners and function calls

I would like to come back to this later and add animations and a theme to this project.
